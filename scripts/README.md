# Gradient Tool #

This is the Python version of the "Gradient Tool" from Warwick's
Systems Biology Centre.


## Application Notes ##

It is assumed that testing is *destructive*, such that variance within
the data of each replicate is the same as that between replicates.

I'm currently targeting Python 3 due to its greater sanity---for
example, `1/2` is `0.5` rather than `0`.  Library support should be
fine at the moment, and backwards compatibility should be easy if/when
needed.
